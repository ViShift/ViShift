The science behind Vi-Shift Glasses

Blue Light Exposure

Modern lifestyles involve extensive exposure to blue light emitted from electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. This blue light can disrupt our natural sleep-wake cycle and strain our eyes.

Lens Filtration

Vi-Shift Glasses employ a specialized lens coating that filters out a specific portion of blue light spectrum, reducing its harmful effects on our eyes and overall health.

Improved Sleep Quality

By reducing blue light exposure, Vi-Shift Glasses promote melatonin production, a hormone essential for regulating sleep patterns, leading to better sleep quality and reduced fatigue.

Eye Strain Relief

The lenses minimize eye strain, headaches, and discomfort often experienced during prolonged digital screen use, ensuring a more comfortable viewing experience.

How Vi-Shift Glasses work

Blue Light Filtration

The lenses are coated with a specialized material that selectively filters out a specific range of blue light wavelengths. This filtering process reduces the harmful blue light reaching the eyes.

Improved Visual Clarity

The lens coating also enhances visual clarity by reducing glare and improving contrast, making it easier to focus and read for extended periods.

Comfortable Viewing Experience

By reducing eye strain and fatigue, Vi-Shift Glasses create a more comfortable viewing experience, allowing you to enjoy your digital devices without discomfort.
